The client source use Extern of Directx8 for more compatibility, I have upload extern of Directx9 and you can edit the source for update on it. 
I will update the source to for use Directx9 because the next project is to replace the whole render water system by a new one for implement water reflection. 

-> Water reflection project:

The problem with the old one is the plane render system, instead to have a VertexBuffer for rendering the water, metin have choose to use a basic rendering system for render multiple plane, so if you implement reflection on the old system you can see duplicate texture reflection on the water and this is not good.
